1 Introduction\nThis part has been done.However, It need some modification later. [Chapter 1](http://lichcnpul.github.io/2015/06/22/1Introduction/)\n## 1.1 Fingerprint Certification System\nFingerprint identification system is an important identity authentication system. It will be more and more important in modern society. Traditional fields such as security system, access control system must use this technology. With the rise of the mobile Internet, more and more emerging fields such as e-commerce, electronic payment also need this technology.\n\nThe traditional fingerprint recognition system adopts the following technical architecture:\n![figure 1](/images/1.png)\nThe business process is as follows:\n1. Users press the fingerprints on the fingerprints sensor.\n2. The sensor is connected to the computer system and sends the user’s fingerprints directly to the computer system.\n3. The similarity of fingerprint data between user and database will be compared.\n4. The fingerprint authentication system judges whether the user is authenticated by the similarity and returns the result to the user.\n\nHowever, with the rise of mobile Internet, the drawbacks of this traditional fingerprint authentication system were exposed. First is security issue, the user fingerprint data stored directly in the system computer, user’s fingerprint image information is easy to be stolen; Second is usability and cost issues, the traditional fingerprint system requires sensor to input users’ fingerprints and the system deployment requires a separate terminal hardware and terminal software. All these lead to increased costs and decreased usability. Third is a scalability issue, the architecture of host-database is not easy to extend. Once scenarios need to use the system, we must purchase the corresponding hardware and software, leading to poor scalability.\n\nIn this paper, the drawbacks of traditional fingerprint identification system has been improved and reorganized. We developed a web-based fingerprint authentication system using smartphone, and used a number of security defense strategies to enhance the security of the system. Finally, the new approach can solve the security, usability, cost and scalability issues in the traditional fingerprint identification system.\nSystem architecture is as follows:\n![figure 2](/images/2.png)\nThe innovation of the system is:\n1. Using smartphone camera instead of the traditional fingerprint sensor, to solve the cost and usability issues.\n2. Using Web Service to provide cross-platform service to solve the cost and scalability issues.\n3. Using enhanced security defense strategy, to solve the security issue.\n\nThis paper focuses on the server solution based on enhanced security strategy.\n\n## 1.2 Security Threat and Defense Strategy\nThe following security threat will occur in the web-based fingerprint authentication system:\n### 1.2.1 Intercept Information\nThe purpose of intercepting information is to steal data content itself. This type of security threat is commonly referred to as data security threats. In the fingerprint authentication system, client needs to send the fingerprint image file to the server through network. During transmission, once the system is attacked, it may cause the fingerprint image data to be intercepted, and then the user information will be stolen.\n![figure 3](/images/3.png)\n### 1.2.2 Replay attack\nDestroying the validity of certification is a basic form of authentication attack. A replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and retransmits it, possibly as part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution.\n\nThe classic example of replay attack is as follows:\n![figure 4](/images/4.png)\nSuppose Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob. Bob requests her password as proof of identity, which Alice dutifully provides (possibly after some transformation like a hash function); meanwhile, Eve is eavesdropping on the conversation and keeps the password (or the hash). After the interchange is over, Eve (posing as Alice) connects to Bob; when asked for a proof of identity, Eve sends Alice’s password (or hash) read from the last session, which Bob accepts thus granting access to Eve.\n![figure 5](/images/5.png)\n### 1.2.3 Data Modification\nThis type of network attacks is an extension of replay attack. Attackers using replay attack damage the system certification to enter the system. Then they can send the forged data to the server easily. And even they will do SQL injection attacks or modify server information. The basic model is as follows:\n![figure 6](/images/6.png)\n\n## 1.3 Fingerprint Certification System with Enhanced Security\n### 1.3.1 Image Encryption\nFor attacks in 1.2.1, the usual defense strategy is image encryption. Before the client sends the image file, we can use a specific algorithm to encrypt image. Then client sends the file to the server. After the server receives the file, we will use the same algorithm to decrypt the image. In this case, even if attackers intercept the image file, he still cannot get the real information, thus preventing information leakage.\n![figure 7](/images/7.png)\n### 1.3.2 Timestamp Authentication\nIt is efficient defense against replay attack to add timestamp to the system. To use this approach, we should ensure synchronization between client and server. First, the server generates a dynamic password from time to time. Second, the client sends a request to get the dynamic password. Finally, client sends username and dynamic password to login system. In this case, even if the middle man steal the password, it is only effective in a very short time.\n![figure 8](/images/8.png)\n### 1.3.3 Challenge-Response Authentication\nChallenge-Response Authentication is another effective method to prevent replay attack. The basic model is as follows:\n1. Client sends a request to login. (We can assume it is ‘GET’ request)\n2. Server generates a random number K=random (NUM), then return K to Client. Besides, server should save K to the session.\n3. Client calculates R=Hmac(K, P), then sends the result to the server. In the formula, K represents key (the random number), P represents user password, Hmac() is a Hash Function.\n4. Server gets the user password from database and does the same calculation R’=hmac() as step 3. Then comparing R’ with R, if R’ equals R, users will login system successfully.\n\nIn this process, the man in the middle can only get K and R, but K is a random number while R is a hash result, the two numbers are both meaningless. Attackers cannot get user password through the two numbers. System security is improved.\n![figure 9](/images/9.png)\n\n## 1.4 Fingerprint Authentication System with Enhanced Security\nThe paper discusses a fingerprint authentication system with enhanced security. First, we will use the new approach to instead of the traditional approach, we will not use fingerprint sensor to get user fingerprint data. Instead, we use smartphone camera to get the user information. It will be more convenient and low cost. Second, we use Web Service to provide web-based authentication service with enhanced security. We use some methods to improve the system security and prevent network attack. Finally, we will realize a new fingerprint authentication system with convenience, security and low cost.\n\nThe paper will be divided into 7 chapters.\nChapter 1 expresses the problems of the existed fingerprints authentication system and gives a new approach to solve the problems.\nChapter 2 introduces the related work of fingerprints system and system security.\nChapter 3 gives the system architecture to show how it works.\nChapter 4 discusses the security strategy to prevent network attack.\nChapter 5 discusses fingerprints matcher web service.\nChapter 6 talks about match results.\nChapter 7 gives the conclusion.\n\n# 2 Related work\nThis part will give some current research. Because our research is comprehensive research.

This part will be divided to two parts. Part One introduces the specification of the hole system; Part Two discusses system framework and how it works.\n## 3.1 Basic Business Process\n### 3.1.1 Business Component\nBusiness component contains four parts:\n1. **Client**: smart phone(Android), fingerprint image acquisition module, feature extraction module, encryption module;\n\n2. **Server**: Web Sever，decryption module, authentication module, fingerprint matching module;\n\n3. **Third-party components**: Fingerprint Matcher SDK;\n\n4. **Database**: fingerprint image database, user database.\n\n### 3.1.2 Business Flow\nThe basic flow of the system is shown below:\n![basic flow](/images/thesis/chapter3/1.bmp)\nBusiness process consists of the following processes:\n1. **Fingerprint Image Acquisition**: User login android client, then the client calls camera and image acquisition module to get user fingerprint image.\n\n2. **Image Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: The client calls feature extraction module to preprocess the fingerprint image and extract the feature of user's fingerprint.\n\n3. **Image Encryption**: First the client receives the QR Code information from server, then it calls encryption module to encode fingerprint image with QR Code information.\n\n4. **Image Upload**: The client calls Web API to upload the encrypted fingerprint images to the server.\n\n5. **Image Decryption**: The server calls decryption module to decode the encrypted fingerprint image, then it will get original fingerprint image and QR Code information.\n\n6. **User Authentication**: The server calls authentication module to check the QR Code information and ensure the authenticity of the user.\n\n7. **Fingerprint Matching**: The server calls Fingerprint Matcher SDK to compare user-uploaded fingerprint image with the fingerprint database, then it will get the matching score.\n\n8. **Result Display**: The server sends the matching score back to the client. Then the client determines whether the user is authenticated by matching score.\n\n## 3.2 SOA and Web Service\n### 3.2.1 SOA\nSOA is service-oriented architecture. Simple, SOA is a kind of new architecture to develop application system. In the system based on SOA architecture, functionality of the application is a combination of the components together. These components are loosely coupled and have a unified interface definitions, we often called the components as service. The advantages of SOA architecture is to achieve cross-platform and scalability of application system.\n\nFor example, in our fingerprint authentication system, now we need achieve an Android client and a server-side. Android client communicates with server-side and calls the API provided by server to achieve the functions of fingerprint upload and fingerprint authentication. In the traditional software architecture, the client and server development should be in the same technical architecture, for example, if the client uses Android technology, the server should also use Java EE technology; if the client uses Windows Phone technology, the server should also use .net framework. The software architecture model is a tightly coupled architecture. The advantage of this model is close cooperation, and the client and server both call the same underlying module. However, the disadvantage of this model is bad scalability. If you use .net technology to develop client side, the server-side has to use the same technology. This kind of architecture is not suitable for the development of mobile internet.\n\nIn the mobile Internet era, a service often provides support for a variety of clients. For example, social software \"Line\" has some service for clients. The login service needs provide support for PC clients, it also needs provide support for Android clients and iOS clients, even it need provide the service for browser. If we use traditional system architecture, we have to write service code for every platform. However, the service code is almost the same. It does not conform the software engineering principle of DRY(Don‘t Repeat Yourself). In this background, SOA architecture have been developed rapidly.\n\nIn SOA architecture each application functions will be packaged as service, while these services are platform-independent. Client communicates with server by message delivery. When the client needs call server API, it can send a message to the server interface, thus achieving the transformation of architecture from specific technology-oriented to service-oriented. Whether the client uses Android technology, or iOS technology, or web technology, or desktop technology, it can call the same service while it is not necessary to change any code in server-side. The SOA architecture model greatly enhanced cross-platform and scalability of application system, now SOA has became mainstream architecture model in mobile Internet era. Web Service is a kind of technology to achieve SOA.\n![SOA](/images/thesis/chapter3/2.bmp)\n### 3.2.2 Web Service\nWeb Service is one of the most commonly used techniques to achieve SOA. It provides services through a standard web protocol, the purpose of Web service is to ensure that different applications can interoperate.（[Web Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)）\n\nAfter years of development, there are two main types of web service currently .\n1. SOAP-based Web Service\n2. REST-based Web Service\n\nSOAP-based Web Service: SOAP is used to describe the format of the information transmitted, WSDL is used to describe how to access specific interface, UDDI is used to manage, distribute, query Web Service. SOAP uses two protocols have been widely used: HTTP and XML(a subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language). HTTP is used to implement RPC-style SOAP transmissions, and XML is its encoding format. By using SOAP, Web Service has a good scalability, completely independent of the vendor, programming language and platform.\n\nREST-based Web Service: Dr. RT Fielding's doctoral dissertation \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\" laid the basis for REST-style Web Service. REST is Representational State Transfer. It has the following characteristics:\n1. First REST is a style, not a standard.\n2. REST is based on resource.\n3. The purpose of REST is to decide how to make a well defined web application forward.\n4. REST makes full use of HTTP　protocol.\n* It locates resources by logic URI.\n* It distinguishes what format of data the client wants to get by HTTP Request Header Information.\n* In REST architecture, the CRUD(create,read,update and delete) operation is handled by using different HTTP request methods.\n\n![REST API](/images/thesis/chapter3/3.bmp)\nThe characteristics of REST style make it more lightweight than SOAP, fuller use HTTP protocol. REST really expresses the original intention of HTTP protocol. REST has completely changed the status of Web Service, adapted to the trend of mobile internet, and now the mainstream mobile client development has shifted to the REST style Web Service. In order to achieve the Android client of fingerprint verification, we also use REST style Web Service in our system.\n## 3.3 Nancy Framework  \nWe use Nancy Framework to achieve a lightweight REST-style Web Service. Nancy Framework is a lightweight web framework based on .Net and mono platforms, it follows the MVC model and is designed to provide REST-style Web Service. On its [official website](http://nancyfx.org/) , it introduces the following features of Nancy:\n1. Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.\n2. Nancy is designed to handle DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PUT and PATCH requests and provides a simple, elegant, Domain Specific Language (DSL) for returning a response with just a couple of keystrokes.\n3. Nancy is built to run anywhere.\n\n### 3.3.1 MVC\nThe design ideas of Nancy Framework comes from Ruby's Sinatra Framework, whose basic idea is MVC model. MVC model is Model-View-Controller mode.\n* Model is a part of application system to deal with data logic, typically used to encapsulate data objects to store data.\n* View is a part of application system to display data to user. View data usually need to be obtained from model.\n* Controller is responsible for reading data from the view, controlling user input, and sending data to the model.\n\n![MVC](/images/thesis/chapter3/4.bmp)\nThe figure shows the basic principle of MVC model:\n1. First, user sends a request to the application, waiting for the server to respond.\n2. Controller receives the user request, then it decides which model or view to respond according to the header of request.\n3. Controller sends data requests to model.\n4. Model gets data from database and returns the data to controller\n5. controller sends the acquired data to the corresponding view.\n6. Fill view according to the model data, and return the results to the controller.\n7. Controller returns view to user.\n\nThrough MVC model, the separation of application business logic and performance is realized. It also reduces the coupling between modules. Now more and more application systems are using MVC model, many frameworks also follow the MVC model, such as Ruby on Rails, Java Spring MVC, ASP.net MVC etc.. The Nancy Framework which we used is also a super lightweight MVC framework on .net platform.\n### 3.3.2 Nancy Framework\nNancy Framework is a super lightweight web framework on .net platform based on MVC mode. The structure of Nancy project is shown below:\n![Nancy](/images/thesis/chapter3/5.png)\nIn Nancy Framework, Model is M, Views is V, Module is C.\n1. Controller uses rest style, the basic mode is as follows: when user inputs uri http://hostaddress/ in the browser, the controller class of Nancy framework will match the corresponding controller based on uri firstly. This mechanism is called Route mechanism, it is the core of Nancy Framework to achieve REST-style controller. When a user requests the resources on root directory in 'GET' method, the controller will find the GET[\"/\"] controller based on Route mechanism. After the match is successful, the user request is processed by the controller. The controller can call the corresponding view resources and model resources in response to user requests.\n``` csharp\nGet[\"/\"] = parameters =>\n{\n    return View[\"index\"];\n};\n```\n2. View takes HTML as the basic style, the official supported view engine is Radar engine, the syntax of Radar is similar to HTML.\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <title>Fingerprint Web Service Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    Content\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n3. Model generally takes Database as objects and supports most of the ORM framework.\n\n## 3.4 System Architecture Diagram\nThe architecture diagram of the fingerprint identification system is as follows:\n![System Architecture](/images/thesis/chapter3/6.bmp)\n\n# 4 Security Strategy\nThis part ([4.1](http://lichcnpul.github.io/2015/06/24/4Security-Strategy/) and [Algorithm](http://lichcnpul.github.io/2015/06/25/Algorithm/)) have been written. However, I am doing some systemative tests, so it will be modified later.\nThis chapter discuss the security strategy in the fingerprint authentication system. First, we will talk about security threat briefly; Second, we discuss the traditional approach to enhance security; Third, we give a fingerprint watermark approach to solve the security problems. We will discuss reversible watermarking technology in this part.\n## 4.1 Security Threat and Common Approach\n### 4.1.1 Security Threat\nAs we have talked in chapter 1, there are some types of internet attack. One is to **intercept information**. The purpose of intercepting information is to steal data content itself. Another one is to **replay attack**. Replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. In our system, attackers will try to intercept user’s packages which contain fingerprint images. This is a kind of intercept attack. In this case, user information will be leaked. In addition, the attackers intercept data packages then they can resend these data packages to the server regardless of whether the data is encrypted. This is a kind of replay attack. Attackers use replay attack to realize the purpose of spoofing server. Then the server will consider the attacker to be the original user.\n\nThe fingerprint authentication system should be security. We try to design some security subsystem to enhance the system security. Then the system should be prevent information interception and replay attack.\n### 4.1.2 Common Approach\nFile encryption and digital signature is a common approach to enhance system security.\n* File encryption : Prevent information leaks.\n* Digital signature : Ensure the message sent by the original sender.\n\nFile encryption： The basic process flow of file encryption is to encode the original file by an algorithm, making it unreadable(commonly referred to as “ciphertext”). The original file cannot be displayed without **key**. By this way we can prevent data from being illegally stolen. The reverse process is called decryption. such as: [Algorithm 1](http://blog.csdn.net/stpeace/article/details/8315772) and [Algorithm 2](http://wenku.baidu.com/link?url=Szecji7gvHr35DDq2ltqNqa4aYdajxnfNinz8WA3_4WWVXKHgj6IFUvjTgY_V-w9eqcz4YppASDBfejSm0cIMGMZA62YlXNME9e2ZfxwVoK)\n\nDigital signature: A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. see [searchsecurity](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature). The basic flow of digital signature is like this:\n![figure 1](/images/thesis/1.png)\nFrom this diagram, we can know how digital-signature works. First, the data sender uses his private key to encode the information he prepared to send, then he gets a signed message. Second, he send the signed message to the receiver. The receiver gets the signed message and decodes the message by the sender’s public key. Then the receiver gets the decrypted hash. If the decrypted hash matches a second computed hash of the same data, it proves that the data hasn’t changed since it was signed. Otherwise, it proves that the data has been changed by attackers since it was signed.\n### 4.1.3 New Approach\nThe traditional approach is good enough to enhance system security and prevent internet attack. However, there are still some disadvantages to apply it to our fingerprint system.\n1. **Complex**. Digital-signature need to be controlled in a complex architecture. Besides, we need to build two separate subsystems, one is for file encryption, the other one is for digital signature. It will be more complex.\n2. **Common Approach**. It is a common approach to enhance system security. It does not take into account the characteristics of the fingerprint image.\n\nIn order to overcome the two drawbacks, we try to propose a new approach. The new approach is a kind of reversible digital watermark technology and it combine file encryption with authentication. We will discuss the detail in 4.3 Solution and 4.4 Algorithm.\n## 4.2 Architecture\n## 4.3 Solution\n## 4.4 Algorithm\n### 4.4.1 Display Matrix\nSuppose the QR Code image matrix is：\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\n255 & 254 & 255 & 1 & 2 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n255 & 255 & 255 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nIts binary form is：\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{10} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{10} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe watermark image matrix is:\n\n$M=\\begin{bmatrix}\n167 & 63 & 15 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n255 & 127 & 128 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nIts binary form is:\n\n$M=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10100111 & 00111111 & 00001111 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11111111 & 01111111 & 10000000 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow we will separate the watermark matrix to encode it to the QRcode matrix.\nLet's focus the watermark matrix first.\n### 4.4.2 Watermark Matrix\nFor the watermark matrix above, we called it M, we can see M(1,1)=167, in binary form, M(1,1)=10100111. We separate it to 4 parts.\n\n<strong><font color=\"red\" size=\"6\">10</font></strong><strong><font color=\"green\" size=\"6\">10</font></strong><strong><font color=\"blue\" size=\"6\">01</font></strong><strong><font color=\"yellow\" size=\"6\">11</font></strong>\n\n1. The Red Part: the 1-2 bit\n2. The Green Part: the 3-4 bit\n3. The Blue Part: the 5-6 bit\n4. The Yellow Part: the 7-8 bit\n\nThen we can get 4 matrix from 4 parts:\n1.The Red Part Matrix is:\n\n$M1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 00 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 01 & 10 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 1 & 2 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2.The Green Part Matrix is:\n\n$M2=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n3.The Blue Part Matrix is:\n\n$M3=\\begin{bmatrix}\n01 & 11 & 11 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 01 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n4.The Yellow Part Matrix is:\n\n$M4=\\begin{bmatrix}\n11 & 11 & 11 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 3 & 3 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### 4.4.3 Encoding Method\n#### 4.4.3.1 Why we can encode QRCode Image with watermark image?\nThe QRCode Image is bigger than watermark image. The rows of QRCode image is 3 times higher than watermark image; the colmns is 5 times higher than watermark image. So we can embed the watermark matrix into qrcode matrix. It is very important. In our method, the watermark matrix M is a 392\\*357 matrix; the qrcode matrix Q is a 900\\*5000 matrix.\n\nIn addition, the QRCode image and watermark image are both grayscale images.\n#### 4.4.3.2 How to encode?\nWe use Least Significant Bit Algorithm. First, we separate matrix Q to 5 parts.\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA&B& \\\\\\\nC&D& \\\\\\\n & &E\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor matrix A,B,C,D, they are all 392\\*357 matrix. E is the rest part of Q.\nThen we use A,B,C,D and M1,M2,M3,M4 to encode. We set the least 2 bits of A,B,C,D to 0. For example:\n\n$A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{10} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{10} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nset the least 2 bits to 0:\n\n$A1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nthen we use matrix M1 instead of the least 2 bits of A:\n```python\nA2 = A1 + M1\n```\nFor B,C,D and M2,M3,M4 ,we do the some operation:\n```python\nB2 = B1 + M2\nC2 = C1 + M3\nD2 = D1 + M4\n```\nAfter that, we will get a new matrix called Q2:\n\n$Q2=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA2&B2& \\\\\\\nC2&D2& \\\\\\\n & &E\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix Q2 contains all the information of watermark images. Now we have realized Encoding Module.\n\n### 4.4.4 Decoding Method\nIt is easy to get the watermark matrix. From Q2 we can extract A2,B2,C2,D2, then we will get M1,M2,M3,M4 by mod([A2,B2,C2,D2],4).\n```python\nM1(i,j) = A2(i,j) mod 4\nM2(i,j) = B2(i,j) mod 4\nM3(i,j) = C2(i,j) mod 4\nM4(i,j) = D2(i,j) mod 4\n```\nFrom M1, M2, M3, M4, we will recover watermark matrix easily.\n```python\nM(i,j)=M4(i,j)＋4 * M3(i,j)＋16 * M2(i,j)＋64 * M1(i,j)\n```\nIn this way, now we have already recover the watermark matrix.\n# 5 Fingerprint Matching\n## 5.1 Basic concept\n## 5.2 Exist Tools\n## 5.3 SourceAFIS\n# 6 Communication and Results\n# 7 Conclusion\n# Reference\n","source":"_posts/150703-thesis.md","raw":"title: thesis\ndate: 2015-07-03 16:48:53\ncategories: Thesis (English Verion)\ntags: thesis\ntoc: true\n---\n# 1 Introduction\nThis part has been done.However, It need some modification later. [Chapter 1](http://lichcnpul.github.io/2015/06/22/1Introduction/)\n## 1.1 Fingerprint Certification System\nFingerprint identification system is an important identity authentication system. It will be more and more important in modern society. Traditional fields such as security system, access control system must use this technology. With the rise of the mobile Internet, more and more emerging fields such as e-commerce, electronic payment also need this technology.\n\nThe traditional fingerprint recognition system adopts the following technical architecture:\n![figure 1](/images/1.png)\nThe business process is as follows:\n1. Users press the fingerprints on the fingerprints sensor.\n2. The sensor is connected to the computer system and sends the user’s fingerprints directly to the computer system.\n3. The similarity of fingerprint data between user and database will be compared.\n4. The fingerprint authentication system judges whether the user is authenticated by the similarity and returns the result to the user.\n\nHowever, with the rise of mobile Internet, the drawbacks of this traditional fingerprint authentication system were exposed. First is security issue, the user fingerprint data stored directly in the system computer, user’s fingerprint image information is easy to be stolen; Second is usability and cost issues, the traditional fingerprint system requires sensor to input users’ fingerprints and the system deployment requires a separate terminal hardware and terminal software. All these lead to increased costs and decreased usability. Third is a scalability issue, the architecture of host-database is not easy to extend. Once scenarios need to use the system, we must purchase the corresponding hardware and software, leading to poor scalability.\n\nIn this paper, the drawbacks of traditional fingerprint identification system has been improved and reorganized. We developed a web-based fingerprint authentication system using smartphone, and used a number of security defense strategies to enhance the security of the system. Finally, the new approach can solve the security, usability, cost and scalability issues in the traditional fingerprint identification system.\nSystem architecture is as follows:\n![figure 2](/images/2.png)\nThe innovation of the system is:\n1. Using smartphone camera instead of the traditional fingerprint sensor, to solve the cost and usability issues.\n2. Using Web Service to provide cross-platform service to solve the cost and scalability issues.\n3. Using enhanced security defense strategy, to solve the security issue.\n\nThis paper focuses on the server solution based on enhanced security strategy.\n\n## 1.2 Security Threat and Defense Strategy\nThe following security threat will occur in the web-based fingerprint authentication system:\n### 1.2.1 Intercept Information\nThe purpose of intercepting information is to steal data content itself. This type of security threat is commonly referred to as data security threats. In the fingerprint authentication system, client needs to send the fingerprint image file to the server through network. During transmission, once the system is attacked, it may cause the fingerprint image data to be intercepted, and then the user information will be stolen.\n![figure 3](/images/3.png)\n### 1.2.2 Replay attack\nDestroying the validity of certification is a basic form of authentication attack. A replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and retransmits it, possibly as part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution.\n\nThe classic example of replay attack is as follows:\n![figure 4](/images/4.png)\nSuppose Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob. Bob requests her password as proof of identity, which Alice dutifully provides (possibly after some transformation like a hash function); meanwhile, Eve is eavesdropping on the conversation and keeps the password (or the hash). After the interchange is over, Eve (posing as Alice) connects to Bob; when asked for a proof of identity, Eve sends Alice’s password (or hash) read from the last session, which Bob accepts thus granting access to Eve.\n![figure 5](/images/5.png)\n### 1.2.3 Data Modification\nThis type of network attacks is an extension of replay attack. Attackers using replay attack damage the system certification to enter the system. Then they can send the forged data to the server easily. And even they will do SQL injection attacks or modify server information. The basic model is as follows:\n![figure 6](/images/6.png)\n\n## 1.3 Fingerprint Certification System with Enhanced Security\n### 1.3.1 Image Encryption\nFor attacks in 1.2.1, the usual defense strategy is image encryption. Before the client sends the image file, we can use a specific algorithm to encrypt image. Then client sends the file to the server. After the server receives the file, we will use the same algorithm to decrypt the image. In this case, even if attackers intercept the image file, he still cannot get the real information, thus preventing information leakage.\n![figure 7](/images/7.png)\n### 1.3.2 Timestamp Authentication\nIt is efficient defense against replay attack to add timestamp to the system. To use this approach, we should ensure synchronization between client and server. First, the server generates a dynamic password from time to time. Second, the client sends a request to get the dynamic password. Finally, client sends username and dynamic password to login system. In this case, even if the middle man steal the password, it is only effective in a very short time.\n![figure 8](/images/8.png)\n### 1.3.3 Challenge-Response Authentication\nChallenge-Response Authentication is another effective method to prevent replay attack. The basic model is as follows:\n1. Client sends a request to login. (We can assume it is ‘GET’ request)\n2. Server generates a random number K=random (NUM), then return K to Client. Besides, server should save K to the session.\n3. Client calculates R=Hmac(K, P), then sends the result to the server. In the formula, K represents key (the random number), P represents user password, Hmac() is a Hash Function.\n4. Server gets the user password from database and does the same calculation R’=hmac() as step 3. Then comparing R’ with R, if R’ equals R, users will login system successfully.\n\nIn this process, the man in the middle can only get K and R, but K is a random number while R is a hash result, the two numbers are both meaningless. Attackers cannot get user password through the two numbers. System security is improved.\n![figure 9](/images/9.png)\n\n## 1.4 Fingerprint Authentication System with Enhanced Security\nThe paper discusses a fingerprint authentication system with enhanced security. First, we will use the new approach to instead of the traditional approach, we will not use fingerprint sensor to get user fingerprint data. Instead, we use smartphone camera to get the user information. It will be more convenient and low cost. Second, we use Web Service to provide web-based authentication service with enhanced security. We use some methods to improve the system security and prevent network attack. Finally, we will realize a new fingerprint authentication system with convenience, security and low cost.\n\nThe paper will be divided into 7 chapters.\nChapter 1 expresses the problems of the existed fingerprints authentication system and gives a new approach to solve the problems.\nChapter 2 introduces the related work of fingerprints system and system security.\nChapter 3 gives the system architecture to show how it works.\nChapter 4 discusses the security strategy to prevent network attack.\nChapter 5 discusses fingerprints matcher web service.\nChapter 6 talks about match results.\nChapter 7 gives the conclusion.\n\n# 2 Related work\nThis part will give some current research. Because our research is comprehensive research.

This part will be divided to two parts. Part One introduces the specification of the hole system; Part Two discusses system framework and how it works.\n## 3.1 Basic Business Process\n### 3.1.1 Business Component\nBusiness component contains four parts:\n1. **Client**: smart phone(Android), fingerprint image acquisition module, feature extraction module, encryption module;\n\n2. **Server**: Web Sever，decryption module, authentication module, fingerprint matching module;\n\n3. **Third-party components**: Fingerprint Matcher SDK;\n\n4. **Database**: fingerprint image database, user database.\n\n### 3.1.2 Business Flow\nThe basic flow of the system is shown below:\n![basic flow](/images/thesis/chapter3/1.bmp)\nBusiness process consists of the following processes:\n1. **Fingerprint Image Acquisition**: User login android client, then the client calls camera and image acquisition module to get user fingerprint image.\n\n2. **Image Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: The client calls feature extraction module to preprocess the fingerprint image and extract the feature of user's fingerprint.\n\n3. **Image Encryption**: First the client receives the QR Code information from server, then it calls encryption module to encode fingerprint image with QR Code information.\n\n4. **Image Upload**: The client calls Web API to upload the encrypted fingerprint images to the server.\n\n5. **Image Decryption**: The server calls decryption module to decode the encrypted fingerprint image, then it will get original fingerprint image and QR Code information.\n\n6. **User Authentication**: The server calls authentication module to check the QR Code information and ensure the authenticity of the user.\n\n7. **Fingerprint Matching**: The server calls Fingerprint Matcher SDK to compare user-uploaded fingerprint image with the fingerprint database, then it will get the matching score.\n\n8. **Result Display**: The server sends the matching score back to the client. Then the client determines whether the user is authenticated by matching score.\n\n## 3.2 SOA and Web Service\n### 3.2.1 SOA\nSOA is service-oriented architecture. Simple, SOA is a kind of new architecture to develop application system. In the system based on SOA architecture, functionality of the application is a combination of the components together. These components are loosely coupled and have a unified interface definitions, we often called the components as service. The advantages of SOA architecture is to achieve cross-platform and scalability of application system.\n\nFor example, in our fingerprint authentication system, now we need achieve an Android client and a server-side. Android client communicates with server-side and calls the API provided by server to achieve the functions of fingerprint upload and fingerprint authentication. In the traditional software architecture, the client and server development should be in the same technical architecture, for example, if the client uses Android technology, the server should also use Java EE technology; if the client uses Windows Phone technology, the server should also use .net framework. The software architecture model is a tightly coupled architecture. The advantage of this model is close cooperation, and the client and server both call the same underlying module. However, the disadvantage of this model is bad scalability. If you use .net technology to develop client side, the server-side has to use the same technology. This kind of architecture is not suitable for the development of mobile internet.\n\nIn the mobile Internet era, a service often provides support for a variety of clients. For example, social software \"Line\" has some service for clients. The login service needs provide support for PC clients, it also needs provide support for Android clients and iOS clients, even it need provide the service for browser. If we use traditional system architecture, we have to write service code for every platform. However, the service code is almost the same. It does not conform the software engineering principle of DRY(Don‘t Repeat Yourself). In this background, SOA architecture have been developed rapidly.\n\nIn SOA architecture each application functions will be packaged as service, while these services are platform-independent. Client communicates with server by message delivery. When the client needs call server API, it can send a message to the server interface, thus achieving the transformation of architecture from specific technology-oriented to service-oriented. Whether the client uses Android technology, or iOS technology, or web technology, or desktop technology, it can call the same service while it is not necessary to change any code in server-side. The SOA architecture model greatly enhanced cross-platform and scalability of application system, now SOA has became mainstream architecture model in mobile Internet era. Web Service is a kind of technology to achieve SOA.\n![SOA](/images/thesis/chapter3/2.bmp)\n### 3.2.2 Web Service\nWeb Service is one of the most commonly used techniques to achieve SOA. It provides services through a standard web protocol, the purpose of Web service is to ensure that different applications can interoperate.（[Web Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)）\n\nAfter years of development, there are two main types of web service currently .\n1. SOAP-based Web Service\n2. REST-based Web Service\n\nSOAP-based Web Service: SOAP is used to describe the format of the information transmitted, WSDL is used to describe how to access specific interface, UDDI is used to manage, distribute, query Web Service. SOAP uses two protocols have been widely used: HTTP and XML(a subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language). HTTP is used to implement RPC-style SOAP transmissions, and XML is its encoding format. By using SOAP, Web Service has a good scalability, completely independent of the vendor, programming language and platform.\n\nREST-based Web Service: Dr. RT Fielding's doctoral dissertation \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\" laid the basis for REST-style Web Service. REST is Representational State Transfer. It has the following characteristics:\n1. First REST is a style, not a standard.\n2. REST is based on resource.\n3. The purpose of REST is to decide how to make a well defined web application forward.\n4. REST makes full use of HTTP　protocol.\n* It locates resources by logic URI.\n* It distinguishes what format of data the client wants to get by HTTP Request Header Information.\n* In REST architecture, the CRUD(create,read,update and delete) operation is handled by using different HTTP request methods.\n\n![REST API](/images/thesis/chapter3/3.bmp)\nThe characteristics of REST style make it more lightweight than SOAP, fuller use HTTP protocol. REST really expresses the original intention of HTTP protocol. REST has completely changed the status of Web Service, adapted to the trend of mobile internet, and now the mainstream mobile client development has shifted to the REST style Web Service. In order to achieve the Android client of fingerprint verification, we also use REST style Web Service in our system.\n## 3.3 Nancy Framework  \nWe use Nancy Framework to achieve a lightweight REST-style Web Service. Nancy Framework is a lightweight web framework based on .Net and mono platforms, it follows the MVC model and is designed to provide REST-style Web Service. On its [official website](http://nancyfx.org/) , it introduces the following features of Nancy:\n1. Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.\n2. Nancy is designed to handle DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PUT and PATCH requests and provides a simple, elegant, Domain Specific Language (DSL) for returning a response with just a couple of keystrokes.\n3. Nancy is built to run anywhere.\n\n### 3.3.1 MVC\nThe design ideas of Nancy Framework comes from Ruby's Sinatra Framework, whose basic idea is MVC model. MVC model is Model-View-Controller mode.\n* Model is a part of application system to deal with data logic, typically used to encapsulate data objects to store data.\n* View is a part of application system to display data to user. View data usually need to be obtained from model.\n* Controller is responsible for reading data from the view, controlling user input, and sending data to the model.\n\n![MVC](/images/thesis/chapter3/4.bmp)\nThe figure shows the basic principle of MVC model:\n1. First, user sends a request to the application, waiting for the server to respond.\n2. Controller receives the user request, then it decides which model or view to respond according to the header of request.\n3. Controller sends data requests to model.\n4. Model gets data from database and returns the data to controller\n5. controller sends the acquired data to the corresponding view.\n6. Fill view according to the model data, and return the results to the controller.\n7. Controller returns view to user.\n\nThrough MVC model, the separation of application business logic and performance is realized. It also reduces the coupling between modules. Now more and more application systems are using MVC model, many frameworks also follow the MVC model, such as Ruby on Rails, Java Spring MVC, ASP.net MVC etc.. The Nancy Framework which we used is also a super lightweight MVC framework on .net platform.\n### 3.3.2 Nancy Framework\nNancy Framework is a super lightweight web framework on .net platform based on MVC mode. The structure of Nancy project is shown below:\n![Nancy](/images/thesis/chapter3/5.png)\nIn Nancy Framework, Model is M, Views is V, Module is C.\n1. Controller uses rest style, the basic mode is as follows: when user inputs uri http://hostaddress/ in the browser, the controller class of Nancy framework will match the corresponding controller based on uri firstly. This mechanism is called Route mechanism, it is the core of Nancy Framework to achieve REST-style controller. When a user requests the resources on root directory in 'GET' method, the controller will find the GET[\"/\"] controller based on Route mechanism. After the match is successful, the user request is processed by the controller. The controller can call the corresponding view resources and model resources in response to user requests.\n``` csharp\nGet[\"/\"] = parameters =>\n{\n    return View[\"index\"];\n};\n```\n2. View takes HTML as the basic style, the official supported view engine is Radar engine, the syntax of Radar is similar to HTML.\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <title>Fingerprint Web Service Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    Content\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n3. Model generally takes Database as objects and supports most of the ORM framework.\n\n## 3.4 System Architecture Diagram\nThe architecture diagram of the fingerprint identification system is as follows:\n![System Architecture](/images/thesis/chapter3/6.bmp)\n\n# 4 Security Strategy\nThis part ([4.1](http://lichcnpul.github.io/2015/06/24/4Security-Strategy/) and [Algorithm](http://lichcnpul.github.io/2015/06/25/Algorithm/)) have been written. However, I am doing some systemative tests, so it will be modified later.\nThis chapter discuss the security strategy in the fingerprint authentication system. First, we will talk about security threat briefly; Second, we discuss the traditional approach to enhance security; Third, we give a fingerprint watermark approach to solve the security problems. We will discuss reversible watermarking technology in this part.\n## 4.1 Security Threat and Common Approach\n### 4.1.1 Security Threat\nAs we have talked in chapter 1, there are some types of internet attack. One is to **intercept information**. The purpose of intercepting information is to steal data content itself. Another one is to **replay attack**. Replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. In our system, attackers will try to intercept user’s packages which contain fingerprint images. This is a kind of intercept attack. In this case, user information will be leaked. In addition, the attackers intercept data packages then they can resend these data packages to the server regardless of whether the data is encrypted. This is a kind of replay attack. Attackers use replay attack to realize the purpose of spoofing server. Then the server will consider the attacker to be the original user.\n\nThe fingerprint authentication system should be security. We try to design some security subsystem to enhance the system security. Then the system should be prevent information interception and replay attack.\n### 4.1.2 Common Approach\nFile encryption and digital signature is a common approach to enhance system security.\n* File encryption : Prevent information leaks.\n* Digital signature : Ensure the message sent by the original sender.\n\nFile encryption： The basic process flow of file encryption is to encode the original file by an algorithm, making it unreadable(commonly referred to as “ciphertext”). The original file cannot be displayed without **key**. By this way we can prevent data from being illegally stolen. The reverse process is called decryption. such as: [Algorithm 1](http://blog.csdn.net/stpeace/article/details/8315772) and [Algorithm 2](http://wenku.baidu.com/link?url=Szecji7gvHr35DDq2ltqNqa4aYdajxnfNinz8WA3_4WWVXKHgj6IFUvjTgY_V-w9eqcz4YppASDBfejSm0cIMGMZA62YlXNME9e2ZfxwVoK)\n\nDigital signature: A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. see [searchsecurity](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature). The basic flow of digital signature is like this:\n![figure 1](/images/thesis/1.png)\nFrom this diagram, we can know how digital-signature works. First, the data sender uses his private key to encode the information he prepared to send, then he gets a signed message. Second, he send the signed message to the receiver. The receiver gets the signed message and decodes the message by the sender’s public key. Then the receiver gets the decrypted hash. If the decrypted hash matches a second computed hash of the same data, it proves that the data hasn’t changed since it was signed. Otherwise, it proves that the data has been changed by attackers since it was signed.\n### 4.1.3 New Approach\nThe traditional approach is good enough to enhance system security and prevent internet attack. However, there are still some disadvantages to apply it to our fingerprint system.\n1. **Complex**. Digital-signature need to be controlled in a complex architecture. Besides, we need to build two separate subsystems, one is for file encryption, the other one is for digital signature. It will be more complex.\n2. **Common Approach**. It is a common approach to enhance system security. It does not take into account the characteristics of the fingerprint image.\n\nIn order to overcome the two drawbacks, we try to propose a new approach. The new approach is a kind of reversible digital watermark technology and it combine file encryption with authentication. We will discuss the detail in 4.3 Solution and 4.4 Algorithm.\n## 4.2 Architecture\n## 4.3 Solution\n## 4.4 Algorithm\n### 4.4.1 Display Matrix\nSuppose the QR Code image matrix is：\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\n255 & 254 & 255 & 1 & 2 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n255 & 255 & 255 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nIts binary form is：\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{10} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{10} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe watermark image matrix is:\n\n$M=\\begin{bmatrix}\n167 & 63 & 15 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n255 & 127 & 128 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nIts binary form is:\n\n$M=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10100111 & 00111111 & 00001111 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11111111 & 01111111 & 10000000 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow we will separate the watermark matrix to encode it to the QRcode matrix.\nLet's focus the watermark matrix first.\n### 4.4.2 Watermark Matrix\nFor the watermark matrix above, we called it M, we can see M(1,1)=167, in binary form, M(1,1)=10100111. We separate it to 4 parts.\n\n<strong><font color=\"red\" size=\"6\">10</font></strong><strong><font color=\"green\" size=\"6\">10</font></strong><strong><font color=\"blue\" size=\"6\">01</font></strong><strong><font color=\"yellow\" size=\"6\">11</font></strong>\n\n1. The Red Part: the 1-2 bit\n2. The Green Part: the 3-4 bit\n3. The Blue Part: the 5-6 bit\n4. The Yellow Part: the 7-8 bit\n\nThen we can get 4 matrix from 4 parts:\n1.The Red Part Matrix is:\n\n$M1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 00 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 01 & 10 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 1 & 2 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2.The Green Part Matrix is:\n\n$M2=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n3.The Blue Part Matrix is:\n\n$M3=\\begin{bmatrix}\n01 & 11 & 11 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 01 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n4.The Yellow Part Matrix is:\n\n$M4=\\begin{bmatrix}\n11 & 11 & 11 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 3 & 3 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### 4.4.3 Encoding Method\n#### 4.4.3.1 Why we can encode QRCode Image with watermark image?\nThe QRCode Image is bigger than watermark image. The rows of QRCode image is 3 times higher than watermark image; the colmns is 5 times higher than watermark image. So we can embed the watermark matrix into qrcode matrix. It is very important. In our method, the watermark matrix M is a 392\\*357 matrix; the qrcode matrix Q is a 900\\*5000 matrix.\n\nIn addition, the QRCode image and watermark image are both grayscale images.\n#### 4.4.3.2 How to encode?\nWe use Least Significant Bit Algorithm. First, we separate matrix Q to 5 parts.\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA&B& \\\\\\\nC&D& \\\\\\\n & &E\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor matrix A,B,C,D, they are all 392\\*357 matrix. E is the rest part of Q.\nThen we use A,B,C,D and M1,M2,M3,M4 to encode. We set the least 2 bits of A,B,C,D to 0. For example:\n\n$A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{10} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{10} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 111111\\color{red}{11} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & 000000\\color{red}{01} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nset the least 2 bits to 0:\n\n$A1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 111111\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & 000000\\color{red}{00} & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nthen we use matrix M1 instead of the least 2 bits of A:\n```python\nA2 = A1 + M1\n```\nFor B,C,D and M2,M3,M4 ,we do the some operation:\n```python\nB2 = B1 + M2\nC2 = C1 + M3\nD2 = D1 + M4\n```\nAfter that, we will get a new matrix called Q2:\n\n$Q2=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA2&B2& \\\\\\\nC2&D2& \\\\\\\n & &E\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix Q2 contains all the information of watermark images. Now we have realized Encoding Module.\n\n### 4.4.4 Decoding Method\nIt is easy to get the watermark matrix. From Q2 we can extract A2,B2,C2,D2, then we will get M1,M2,M3,M4 by mod([A2,B2,C2,D2],4).\n```python\nM1(i,j) = A2(i,j) mod 4\nM2(i,j) = B2(i,j) mod 4\nM3(i,j) = C2(i,j) mod 4\nM4(i,j) = D2(i,j) mod 4\n```\nFrom M1, M2, M3, M4, we will recover watermark matrix easily.\n```python\nM(i,j)=M4(i,j)＋4 * M3(i,j)＋16 * M2(i,j)＋64 * M1(i,j)\n```\nIn this way, now we have already recover the watermark matrix.\n# 5 Fingerprint Matching\n## 5.1 Basic concept\n## 5.2 Exist Tools\n## 5.3 SourceAFIS\n# 6 Communication and Results\n# 7 Conclusion\n# Reference\n","slug":"150703-thesis","published":1,"updated":"2015-07-07T12:58:38.846Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cibtdpccx0000ecsvkhus76v2"},{"title":"thesis","date":"2015-07-01T12:29:23.000Z","toc":true,"_content":"# Network-based Fingerprint Authentication System Using a Mobile Device\n## Abstract:\nPresent fingerprint system has problems in security, usability and cost. In this case, we propose a touch-less fingerprint authentication method.  Use mobile device’s built-in camera to capture fingerprint image, and then send it to the server to complete the identity authentication work. Based on this method, the system comprises capture, preprocessing, matching stages and is implemented in a prototype as application for the Android OS. The experimental results show that our method is feasible and lets off some potential problems in the touch-based fingerprint technology.\n## Key words:\n*Fingerprint authentication*, *touch-less*, *network-based*, *mobile device*\n## 1 Introduction\nMore than a century has passed since the Home Ministry Office, UK, accepted that no two individuals have the same fingerprints and then industriously practiced the idea for solving crimes [1]. Nowadays, due to increasing concerns about security and identity fraud have created a growing need for fingerprint for person recognition, fingerprint authentication is not only needed in forensic applications, but also in a large number of non-forensic applications. The present fingerprint authentication systems are generally called Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS). AFIS accept live-scan digital images acquired with an electronic fingerprint scanner where the finger surface is directly sensed.\n\nHowever, the seems-good system has the potential problems in security, usability and cost. For example, an e-payment in a convenient store, a usual procedure is (1) put a finger on the scanner for ensuring (2) the POS deals with obtained fingerprint according to the local database (3) if the fingerprint is matched, e-payment is completed. In this process, security problems happens, which fingerprint left on the reader may be duplicated by others and applications may leak fingerprint information. In usability aspect, fingerprint system (FP System) is wired and bulky. The other problem is FP system equipment is expensive and maintenance expense is cost, for instance software updating and hardware upgrading both cost money.\n\nDue to the case above, this paper proposes a network-based finger authentication using a camera. This method is that user uses mobile device’s built-in camera to capture fingerprint (FP) image, and send preprocessed FP image to the server through Internet, then the server send back feedback after matches this FP image with initial fingerprint stored in database. The client reacts according to the feedback.\n\nAllowing for smartphone’s some advantages:  (1) the build-in camera has zooming, auto-focusing and high resolution that is suitable to capture high quality images (2)affordable cost [2] (3)the enough computational capacities to process the photos and execute algorithms, we opted for the smartphone as our experiment tool.  There are no extra devices needed to perform the proposed solution. The capture process is touch-less, so no latent fingerprint is left. In addition, sending FP and receiving feedback is wireless, just through the Internet, hence, it is convenient.  Compared with present AFIS, our method is much safer, stronger usability and less cost.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will talk about related works in the touch-less finger recognition. Section 3 will discuss the challenges of fingerprint image authentication. Section 4 will talk about procedure and detailed algorithm design. Section 5 will show the basic architecture of the system. Section 6 will show experiment results. Section 7 is discussion. Section 8 is the conclusion.\n\n## 2 Background\n### 2.1 Biometrics System Model\nBiometric systems generally comprise three basic components [3]:\n* An automated mechanism scans and captures a digital or analogue image of a living individual’s characteristics.\n* Another mechanism handles compression, processing, storage and comparison of the collected data with the stored data.\n* A third component interfaces with the application system to which the user is attempting to gain access.\n\nObviously, the configuration of such a system may be altered to suit a particular situation. However, the majority of biometric control systems follow this simple model.\n\nIt should be noted that there is one crucial step required in setting up a biometric system: enrollment. The only way to gain access to a biometrical controlled system is to enroll.\n\nEnrollment is required to generate a reference template. The methods of enrollment vary according to the device used but usually involve scanning the required biometric data a number of times to gain an accurate measurement. A template is then created and linked to the user’s identity. This template provides the reference for comparison when access attempts are made.\n\n### 2.2 Overview of current AFIS\nGenerally, a fingerprint system designer make sure that the system makes the correct trade-offs. These trade-offs may include recognition accuracy, response time, system integrity, complexity, cost (component price as well as integration and support costs), privacy, government standards, liveness detection, ease of integration, durability, modality of usage, etc. A good fingerprint recognition system should provide a good balance of security, privacy, convenience, and accountability.\n\nBased on the model above, current AFIS is consists of sensors, fingerprint processing and matching hardware and software. Because of fingerprint recognition’s advantages, AFIS are now being increasingly used in many fields.\n![Figure 1](/images/thesis2/image1.png)\nFigure 1 shows various applications involving electronic access or transaction that require reliable automatic user recognition.\n## 2.3 Fingerprint authentication in Electronic Payment\nAn application in E-payment using fingerprint authentication is called fingerprint payment system. Fingerprint payment system allows the consumer to pay with the touch of a finger on a fingerprint scanner. Biometric payment providers require completion of a pre-enrollment process in which index fingers are scanned and address and banking information is recorded in an account database [12]. This transactions process reportedly takes a few seconds. The service was launched in United States in 2005 and spread swiftly into worldwide. For example, Walmart, 7-11 and Taobao all support the service.\n![Figure 2](/images/thesis2/image2.png)\nFigure 2 shows the workflow and its problems.\n## 2.4 Disadvantages of touch based sensors\nThe sensor is the most critical component of the entire fingerprint recognition process. Recognition is highly dependent on the quality of the captured fingerprint image as in less noise, and better image. The core technology used to manufacture the sensors can introduce noise and errors on the captured fingerprint image, influencing the recognition to such a negative extreme that you could be continuously rejected by the system (false rejection) or somebody else could be granted access to the system instead of you (false acceptance).\n\nCurrent fingerprint capture method is touch-based. In order to acquire fingerprint images, the touch-based fingerprint sensors require the user to place his finger on the flat window of the sensor. Because the skin of the finger is not flat, the user must apply enough pressure on the window to obtain sufficient size and achieve good image quality. However, this pressure produces unavoidable physical distortion in arbitrary directions, which is represented differently throughout every area of the same fingerprint image [4] .During the touch, the fingerprint can be acquired with different technologies. There are two main types of touch-based technologies: optical sensors and IC’s or CMOS sensors. Optical sensors are more accurate than IC’s, but they have the similar problems of above.\n![Figure 3](/images/thesis2/image3.png)\nFigure 3 shows the images from touch based sensor using different impression strength.\n\nAs the sensor’s protecting layer is thin, its continuous usage will destroy its surface, making the device useless. In everyday life, things are even worst. You usually use your hands for different tasks and you usually touch different types of materials. Small portions of the objects you touch accumulate on the skin of your finger. When you touch the fingerprint sensor, you deposit these materials on its surface. Additionally, your skin produces sweat (a combination of water and different types of salts) and the sebum (an oily/waxy substance our body produces). When you touch the surface of a fingerprint sensor, the mix of the sweat, sebum and any substance accumulate during your daily activities become a killer combination for the sensor surface that speeds up the destruction of its surface.

In this case, we propose a touch-less fingerprint authentication method.  Use mobile device’s built-in camera to capture fingerprint image, and then send it to the server to complete the identity authentication work. Based on this method, the system comprises capture, preprocessing, matching stages and is implemented in a prototype as application for the Android OS. The experimental results show that our method is feasible and lets off some potential problems in the touch-based fingerprint technology.\n## Key words:\n*Fingerprint authentication*, *touch-less*, *network-based*, *mobile device*\n## 1 Introduction\nMore than a century has passed since the Home Ministry Office, UK, accepted that no two individuals have the same fingerprints and then industriously practiced the idea for solving crimes [1]. Nowadays, due to increasing concerns about security and identity fraud have created a growing need for fingerprint for person recognition, fingerprint authentication is not only needed in forensic applications, but also in a large number of non-forensic applications. The present fingerprint authentication systems are generally called Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS). AFIS accept live-scan digital images acquired with an electronic fingerprint scanner where the finger surface is directly sensed.\n\nHowever, the seems-good system has the potential problems in security, usability and cost. For example, an e-payment in a convenient store, a usual procedure is (1) put a finger on the scanner for ensuring (2) the POS deals with obtained fingerprint according to the local database (3) if the fingerprint is matched, e-payment is completed. In this process, security problems happens, which fingerprint left on the reader may be duplicated by others and applications may leak fingerprint information. In usability aspect, fingerprint system (FP System) is wired and bulky. The other problem is FP system equipment is expensive and maintenance expense is cost, for instance software updating and hardware upgrading both cost money.\n\nDue to the case above, this paper proposes a network-based finger authentication using a camera. This method is that user uses mobile device’s built-in camera to capture fingerprint (FP) image, and send preprocessed FP image to the server through Internet, then the server send back feedback after matches this FP image with initial fingerprint stored in database. The client reacts according to the feedback.\n\nAllowing for smartphone’s some advantages:  (1) the build-in camera has zooming, auto-focusing and high resolution that is suitable to capture high quality images (2)affordable cost [2] (3)the enough computational capacities to process the photos and execute algorithms, we opted for the smartphone as our experiment tool.  There are no extra devices needed to perform the proposed solution. The capture process is touch-less, so no latent fingerprint is left. In addition, sending FP and receiving feedback is wireless, just through the Internet, hence, it is convenient.  Compared with present AFIS, our method is much safer, stronger usability and less cost.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will talk about related works in the touch-less finger recognition. Section 3 will discuss the challenges of fingerprint image authentication. Section 4 will talk about procedure and detailed algorithm design. Section 5 will show the basic architecture of the system. Section 6 will show experiment results. Section 7 is discussion. Section 8 is the conclusion.\n\n## 2 Background\n### 2.1 Biometrics System Model\nBiometric systems generally comprise three basic components [3]:\n* An automated mechanism scans and captures a digital or analogue image of a living individual’s characteristics.\n* Another mechanism handles compression, processing, storage and comparison of the collected data with the stored data.\n* A third component interfaces with the application system to which the user is attempting to gain access.\n\nObviously, the configuration of such a system may be altered to suit a particular situation. However, the majority of biometric control systems follow this simple model.\n\nIt should be noted that there is one crucial step required in setting up a biometric system: enrollment. The only way to gain access to a biometrical controlled system is to enroll.\n\nEnrollment is required to generate a reference template. The methods of enrollment vary according to the device used but usually involve scanning the required biometric data a number of times to gain an accurate measurement. A template is then created and linked to the user’s identity. This template provides the reference for comparison when access attempts are made.\n\n### 2.2 Overview of current AFIS\nGenerally, a fingerprint system designer make sure that the system makes the correct trade-offs. These trade-offs may include recognition accuracy, response time, system integrity, complexity, cost (component price as well as integration and support costs), privacy, government standards, liveness detection, ease of integration, durability, modality of usage, etc. A good fingerprint recognition system should provide a good balance of security, privacy, convenience, and accountability.\n\nBased on the model above, current AFIS is consists of sensors, fingerprint processing and matching hardware and software. Because of fingerprint recognition’s advantages, AFIS are now being increasingly used in many fields.\n![Figure 1](/images/thesis2/image1.png)\nFigure 1 shows various applications involving electronic access or transaction that require reliable automatic user recognition.\n## 2.3 Fingerprint authentication in Electronic Payment\nAn application in E-payment using fingerprint authentication is called fingerprint payment system. Fingerprint payment system allows the consumer to pay with the touch of a finger on a fingerprint scanner. Biometric payment providers require completion of a pre-enrollment process in which index fingers are scanned and address and banking information is recorded in an account database [12]. This transactions process reportedly takes a few seconds. The service was launched in United States in 2005 and spread swiftly into worldwide. For example, Walmart, 7-11 and Taobao all support the service.\n![Figure 2](/images/thesis2/image2.png)\nFigure 2 shows the workflow and its problems.\n## 2.4 Disadvantages of touch based sensors\nThe sensor is the most critical component of the entire fingerprint recognition process. Recognition is highly dependent on the quality of the captured fingerprint image as in less noise, and better image. The core technology used to manufacture the sensors can introduce noise and errors on the captured fingerprint image, influencing the recognition to such a negative extreme that you could be continuously rejected by the system (false rejection) or somebody else could be granted access to the system instead of you (false acceptance).\n\nCurrent fingerprint capture method is touch-based. In order to acquire fingerprint images, the touch-based fingerprint sensors require the user to place his finger on the flat window of the sensor. Because the skin of the finger is not flat, the user must apply enough pressure on the window to obtain sufficient size and achieve good image quality. However, this pressure produces unavoidable physical distortion in arbitrary directions, which is represented differently throughout every area of the same fingerprint image [4] .During the touch, the fingerprint can be acquired with different technologies. There are two main types of touch-based technologies: optical sensors and IC’s or CMOS sensors. Optical sensors are more accurate than IC’s, but they have the similar problems of above.\n![Figure 3](/images/thesis2/image3.png)\nFigure 3 shows the images from touch based sensor using different impression strength.\n\nAs the sensor’s protecting layer is thin, its continuous usage will destroy its surface, making the device useless. In everyday life, things are even worst. You usually use your hands for different tasks and you usually touch different types of materials. Small portions of the objects you touch accumulate on the skin of your finger. When you touch the fingerprint sensor, you deposit these materials on its surface. Additionally, your skin produces sweat (a combination of water and different types of salts) and the sebum (an oily/waxy substance our body produces). When you touch the surface of a fingerprint sensor, the mix of the sweat, sebum and any substance accumulate during your daily activities become a killer combination for the sensor surface that speeds up the destruction of its surface. Fingerprint sensor manufacturers never achieved great success in this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, after pressing on the surface, a latent fingerprint will be left on it. A latent fingerprint refers to the trail of fingerprint on the surface of the sensor. This can lead to fraudulent use, such as the faking of fingerprints, as well as hygienic problems.\n![Figure 4](/images/thesis2/image4.png)\nFigure 4 shows the latent fingerprint on a sensor [1].\n\nIn addition, a set of fingerprint recognition system equipment is expensive and its maintenance expense is cost, for instance software updating and hardware upgrading both cost money.\n\nAs shown above in Figure 2, current fingerprint authentication system based on touched sensors almost have similar problems.\n\n## 3 Related Work\nTo date, several approaches for touch-less fingerprint recognition system have been reported.

matrix.\nLet's focus the watermark matrix first.\n## Watermark Matrix\nFor the watermark matrix above, we called it M, we can see M(1,1)=167, in binary form, M(1,1)=10100111. We separate it to 4 parts.\n\n<strong><font color=\"red\" size=\"6\">10</font></strong><strong><font color=\"green\" size=\"6\">10</font></strong><strong><font color=\"blue\" size=\"6\">01</font></strong><strong><font color=\"yellow\" size=\"6\">11</font></strong>\n\n1. The Red Part: the 1-2 bit\n2. The Green Part: the 3-4 bit\n3. The Blue Part: the 5-6 bit\n4. The Yellow Part: the 7-8 bit\n\nThen we can get 4 matrix from 4 parts:\n1.The Red Part Matrix is:\n\n$M1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 00 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 01 & 10 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 1 & 2 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2.The Green Part Matrix is:\n\n$M2=\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n3.The Blue Part Matrix is:\n\n$M3=\\begin{bmatrix}\n01 & 11 & 11 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 01 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n4.The Yellow Part Matrix is:\n\n$M4=\\begin{bmatrix}\n11 & 11 & 11 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n11 & 11 & 00 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 3 & 3 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n3 & 3 & 0 & \\cdots\\\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n## Encoding Method\n### Why we can encode QRCode Image with watermark image?\nThe QRCode Image is bigger than watermark image. The rows of QRCode image is 3 times higher than watermark image; the colmns is 5 times higher than watermark image. So we can embed the watermark matrix into qrcode matrix. It is very important. In our method, the watermark matrix M is a 392\\*357 matrix; the qrcode matrix Q is a 900\\*5000 matrix.\n\nIn addition, the QRCode image and watermark image are both grayscale images.\n### How to encode?\nWe use Least Significant Bit Algorithm. First, we separate matrix Q to 5 parts.\n\n$Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA&B& \\\\\\\nC&D& \\\\\\\n & &E\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor matrix A,B,C,D, they are all 392\\*357 matrix. E is the rest part of Q.\nThen we use A,B,C,D and M1,M2,M3,M4 to encode. We set the least 2 bits of A,B,C,D to 0.

The rows of QRCode image is 3 times higher than watermark image; the colmns is 5 times higher than watermark image. So we can embed the watermark matrix into qrcode matrix. It is very important. In our method, the watermark matrix M is a 392\\*357 matrix; the qrcode matrix Q is a 900\\*5000 matrix.\n\nIn addition, the QRCode image and watermark image are both grayscale images.\n### How to encode?\nWe use Least Significant Bit Algorithm.

First, we will talk about security threat briefly; Second, we discuss the traditional approach to enhance security; Third, we give a fingerprint watermark approach to solve the security problems. We will discuss reversible watermarking technology in this part.\n## 4.1 Security Threat and Common Approach\n### 4.1.1 Security Threat\nAs we have talked in chapter 1, there are some types of internet attack. One is to **intercept information**. The purpose of intercepting information is to steal data content itself. Another one is to **replay attack**. Replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. In our system, attackers will try to intercept user’s packages which contain fingerprint images. This is a kind of intercept attack. In this case, user information will be leaked. In addition, the attackers intercept data packages then they can resend these data packages to the server regardless of whether the data is encrypted. This is a kind of replay attack. Attackers use replay attack to realize the purpose of spoofing server. Then the server will consider the attacker to be the original user.\n\nThe fingerprint authentication system should be security. We try to design some security subsystem to enhance the system security. Then the system should be prevent information interception and replay attack.\n### 4.1.2 Common Approach\nFile encryption and digital signature is a common approach to enhance system security.\n* File encryption : Prevent information leaks.\n* Digital signature : Ensure the message sent by the original sender.\n\nFile encryption： The basic process flow of file encryption is to encode the original file by an algorithm, making it unreadable(commonly referred to as “ciphertext”). The original file cannot be displayed without **key**. By this way we can prevent data from being illegally stolen. The reverse process is called decryption. such as: [Algorithm 1](http://blog.csdn.net/stpeace/article/details/8315772) and [Algorithm 2](http://wenku.baidu.com/link?url=Szecji7gvHr35DDq2ltqNqa4aYdajxnfNinz8WA3_4WWVXKHgj6IFUvjTgY_V-w9eqcz4YppASDBfejSm0cIMGMZA62YlXNME9e2ZfxwVoK)\n\nDigital signature: A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. see [searchsecurity](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature). The basic flow of digital signature is like this:\n![figure 1](/images/thesis/1.png)\nFrom this diagram, we can know how digital-signature works. First, the data sender uses his private key to encode the information he prepared to send, then he gets a signed message. Second, he send the signed message to the receiver. The receiver gets the signed message and decodes the message by the sender’s public key. Then the receiver gets the decrypted hash. If the decrypted hash matches a second computed hash of the same data, it proves that the data hasn’t changed since it was signed. Otherwise, it proves that the data has been changed by attackers since it was signed.\n### 4.1.3 New Approach\nThe traditional approach is good enough to enhance system security and prevent internet attack. However, there are still some disadvantages to apply it to our fingerprint system.\n1. **Complex**. Digital-signature need to be controlled in a complex architecture. Besides, we need to build two separate subsystems, one is for file encryption, the other one is for digital signature. It will be more complex.\n2. **Common Approach**. It is a common approach to enhance system security. It does not take into account the characteristics of the fingerprint image.\n\nIn order to overcome the two drawbacks, we try to propose a new approach. The new approach is a kind of reversible digital watermark technology and it combine file encryption with authentication.

Introduction","date":"2015-06-22T08:55:14.000Z","toc":true,"_content":"# Chapter 1 Introduction\n## 1.1 Fingerprint Authentication System\nFingerprint identification system is an important identity authentication system. It will be more and more important in modern society. Traditional fields such as security system, access control system must use this technology. With the rise of the mobile Internet, more and more emerging fields such as e-commerce, electronic payment also need this technology.\n\nThe traditional fingerprint recognition system adopts the following technical architecture:\n![figure 1](/images/1.png)\nThe business process is as follows:\n1. Users press the fingerprints on the fingerprints sensor.\n2. The sensor is connected to the computer system and sends the user’s fingerprints directly to the computer system.\n3. The similarity of fingerprint data between user and database will be compared.\n4. The fingerprint authentication system judges whether the user is authenticated by the similarity and returns the result to the user.\n\nHowever, with the rise of mobile Internet, the drawbacks of this traditional fingerprint authentication system were exposed. First is security issue, the user fingerprint data stored directly in the system computer, user’s fingerprint image information is easy to be stolen; Second is usability and cost issues, the traditional fingerprint system requires sensor to input users’ fingerprints and the system deployment requires a separate terminal hardware and terminal software. All these lead to increased costs and decreased usability. Third is a scalability issue, the architecture of host-database is not easy to extend. Once scenarios need to use the system, we must purchase the corresponding hardware and software, leading to poor scalability.\n\nIn this paper, the drawbacks of traditional fingerprint identification system has been improved and reorganized. We developed a web-based fingerprint authentication system using smartphone, and used a number of security defense strategies to enhance the security of the system. Finally, the new approach can solve the security, usability, cost and scalability issues in the traditional fingerprint identification system.\nSystem architecture is as follows:\n![figure 2](/images/2.png)\nThe innovation of the system is:\n1. Using smartphone camera instead of the traditional fingerprint sensor, to solve the cost and usability issues.\n2. Using Web Service to provide cross-platform service to solve the cost and scalability issues.\n3. Using enhanced security defense strategy, to solve the security issue.\n\nThis paper focuses on the server solution based on enhanced security strategy.\n## 1.2 Security Threat\nThe following security threat will occur in the web-based fingerprint authentication system:\n### 1.2.1 Intercept Information\nThe purpose of intercepting information is to steal data content itself. This type of security threat is commonly referred to as data security threats. In the fingerprint authentication system, client needs to send the fingerprint image file to the server through network. During transmission, once the system is attacked, it may cause the fingerprint image data to be intercepted, and then the user information will be stolen.\n![figure 3](/images/3.png)\n### 1.2.2 Replay attack\nDestroying the validity of certification is a basic form of authentication attack. A replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and retransmits it, possibly as part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution.\n\nThe classic example of replay attack is as follows:\n![figure 4](/images/4.png)\nSuppose Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob. Bob requests her password as proof of identity, which Alice dutifully provides (possibly after some transformation like a hash function); meanwhile, Eve is eavesdropping on the conversation and keeps the password (or the hash). After the interchange is over, Eve (posing as Alice) connects to Bob; when asked for a proof of identity, Eve sends Alice’s password (or hash) read from the last session, which Bob accepts thus granting access to Eve.\n![figure 5](/images/5.png)\n### 1.2.3 Data Modification\nThis type of network attacks is an extension of replay attack. Attackers using replay attack damage the system certification to enter the system. Then they can send the forged data to the server easily. And even they will do SQL injection attacks or modify server information. The basic model is as follows:\n![figure 6](/images/6.png)\n## 1.3 Defense Strategy\n### 1.3.1 Image Encryption\nFor attacks in 1.2.1, the usual defense strategy is image encryption. Before the client sends the image file, we can use a specific algorithm to encrypt image. Then client sends the file to the server. After the server receives the file, we will use the same algorithm to decrypt the image. In this case, even if attackers intercept the image file, he still cannot get the real information, thus preventing information leakage.\n![figure 7](/images/7.png)\n### 1.3.2 Timestamp Authentication\nIt is efficient defense against replay attack to add timestamp to the system. To use this approach, we should ensure synchronization between client and server. First, the server generates a dynamic password from time to time. Second, the client sends a request to get the dynamic password. Finally, client sends username and dynamic password to login system. In this case, even if the middle man steal the password, it is only effective in a very short time.\n![figure 8](/images/8.png)\n### 1.3.3 Challenge-Response Authentication\nChallenge-Response Authentication is another effective method to prevent replay attack. The basic model is as follows:\n1. Client sends a request to login. (We can assume it is ‘GET’ request)\n2. Server generates a random number K=random (NUM), then return K to Client. Besides, server should save K to the session.\n3. Client calculates R=Hmac(K, P), then sends the result to the server. In the formula, K represents key (the random number), P represents user password, Hmac() is a Hash Function.\n4. Server gets the user password from database and does the same calculation R’=hmac() as step 3. Then comparing R’ with R, if R’ equals R, users will login system successfully.\n\nIn this process, the man in the middle can only get K and R, but K is a random number while R is a hash result, the two numbers are both meaningless. Attackers cannot get user password through the two numbers. System security is improved.\n![figure 9](/images/9.png)\n## 1.4 Fingerprint Authentication System with Enhanced Security\nThe paper discusses a fingerprint authentication system with enhanced security. First, we will use the new approach to instead of the traditional approach, we will not use fingerprint sensor to get user fingerprint data. Instead, we use smartphone camera to get the user information. It will be more convenient and low cost. Second, we use Web Service to provide web-based authentication service with enhanced security. We use some methods to improve the system security and prevent network attack. Finally, we will realize a new fingerprint authentication system with convenience, security and low cost.\n\nThe paper will be divided into 7 chapters.\nChapter 1 expresses the problems of the existed fingerprints authentication system and gives a new approach to solve the problems.\nChapter 2 introduces the related work of fingerprints system and system security.\nChapter 3 gives the system architecture to show how it works.\nChapter 4 discusses the security strategy to prevent network attack.\nChapter 5 discusses fingerprints matcher web service.\nChapter 6 I have no idea now.\nChapter 7 gives the conclusion.\n","source":"_posts/1Introduction.md","raw":"title: 1.
